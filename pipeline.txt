Any visual odometry consists of the following components
- Feature detection
- Feature matching/tracking
- Motion estimation
- Local optimization

Feature Detection

Detect a set of features f_k at time step k.

Feature Matching

tracking and matching: either locally search eah feature or
or similartiy metric etc

Motion estimate

Compute transformation T_k between two images from the set of features.
Different algorithms:
    2D to 2D
    3D to 3D
    3D to 2D

Local optimization

iterative refinement over the last m poses (optionally performed).

MINIMIZE THE REPROJECTION ERROR


VO is a special case of SFM
